#Getting your credentials
#You can get your credentials by clicking on the arrow next to your email address once you're logged into your site and #then clicking on settings. If you don't have any credentials then you can create one for yourself by going to #/v1/oauth/flow. Once completed go back to the settings page and you should see the credential you just created
